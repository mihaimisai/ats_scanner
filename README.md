# AI-Powered ATS Optimizer

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The **AI-Powered ATS Optimizer** is a sophisticated tool designed to empower job seekers by optimizing their resumes against specific job descriptions. In today's competitive job market, Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) often act as initial gatekeepers, filtering out resumes that don't precisely match job requirements. This project tackles that challenge head-on, providing a clear match score, identifying missing keywords, and offering cutting-edge AI assistance to refine resume content, ensuring it stands out to both automated systems and human recruiters.

This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of skills in **Data Engineering, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Test-Driven Development (TDD), and MLOps/DevOps practices**, making it an ideal showcase piece for a professional portfolio.
